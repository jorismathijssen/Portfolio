## 7. Performance
- **Goal:** Ensure smooth UI and efficient code.
- **Tasks:**
  - Debounce resize events for effects if needed.
  - Optimize event listener cleanup.
  - Optimize images in `public/` (compression, correct sizes).
  - Ensure font files are subsetted and optimized for performance.

## 8. Testing
- **Goal:** Ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
- **Tasks:**
  - Add unit tests for command parsing and effect helpers.
  - Add component tests for Terminal, Toaster, and Modal (e.g., using React Testing Library).
  - Add accessibility tests for modal and keyboard navigation.

## 9. Documentation & Onboarding
- **Goal:** Make the codebase easy to understand and contribute to.
- **Tasks:**

  - Research and implement a zero-downtime deployment strategy:
    - If using Vercel/Netlify: These platforms handle atomic swaps automatically for near-100% uptime.
    - If self-hosted (Docker, Nginx, etc.):
      - Use blue-green or canary deployment patterns.
      - Deploy new version to a separate environment, run health checks, then swap traffic (e.g., update Nginx config or use a load balancer).
      - Only switch live traffic after the new deployment passes health checks.
  - Document the chosen approach and any required configuration changes.

## 11. Modern Best Practices & npm Packages

  - Add SEO enhancements with `next-seo`.
  - Use environment variable management tools (e.g., `dotenv`, `env-cmd`).
  - Add error monitoring and logging (e.g., `sentry`, `logrocket`).
  - Use Husky and lint-staged for pre-commit hooks and code quality.
  - Keep all dependencies up to date and audit for vulnerabilities.
