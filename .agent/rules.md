# Project Rules & Guidelines

## Core Philosophy

- **Showoff Project**: This code is a public example of professional software engineering. It must be clean, well-structured, and follow best practices.
- **Safety First**: Security is paramount. No vulnerabilities, secure defaults, and proper error handling.
- **Performance Perfect**: The application must be highly optimized. Minimal bundle sizes, fast load times, and efficient resource usage.
- **Simplicity**: While the architecture is robust, the code itself should remain simple and readable. Avoid over-engineering.

## Infrastructure

- **Hosting**: Debian server running Docker.
- **Containerization**: All components must be containerized using Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployment capable.

## Development Standards

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **Code Style**: Strict ESLint and Prettier configurations.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for critical paths.
- **Documentation**: Keep `README.md`, `TODO.md`, and `SECURITY.md` up to date.
